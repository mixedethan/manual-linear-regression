# ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression from Scratch (Gradient Descent)

This project implements **linear regression from scratch** using both Python and NumPy. It uses **gradient descent** to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) and find the regression best fitting line for a dataset of students' study hours vs. their test scores.

---

## What It Does

- Loads CSV data: `[hours studied, test scores]`
- Computes the best-fit line using gradient descent
- Plots the data points and the regression line
- Displays the final line equation on the graph

---

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib

# Run the script
python linear_regression.py
```

---

## Files

- `linear_regression.py` - main implementation
- `data.csv` - sample dataset
- `README.md` - project overview
